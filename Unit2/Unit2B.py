At 6.00 p.m. on Thursday, in Waterstones in Piccadilly,
Av staff were running around with bowls of jelly

beans and bottles of raspberry lemonade. Five minutes
later, people of all ages started to come through the doors, some
dressed up as characters from the books ‚Äî a small girl even
produced an owl cage! ‚ÄòI‚Äôm reading the fifth book again at the
moment‚Äô, said 28-year-old Alex. ‚ÄúThis is the third event I‚Äôve
been to. Last year they transformed the second floor into Diagon
Alley.‚Äô In many of the chain‚Äôs 275 branches across the UK, similar
scenes were taking place. ‚ÄòOur first wizards have arrived for
#harrypotterbooknight‚Äô, tweeted staff at the Bradford store.

But Harry Potter night wasn‚Äôt the only cause for celebration
for staff and customers. The previous day, Waterstones

had announced that it was back in profit for the first time
since 2011, under the leadership of its very own wizard,
James Daunt. Daunt was already a successful bookseller, who
had many loyal customers. He was brought in to rescue the
Waterstones chain when it was about to close down.

When Daunt took over Waterstones, his first task was to cut
costs. Then he had to make the stores more attractive and
improve the lighting. Coffee shops were opened inside the
stores, and events were held, such as the now-famous Harry
Potter nights, or talks by authors. But the biggest change was

that Daunt gave each individual store the power to choose
what books to sell, and to choose the prices for different books.
This made a big difference. Sales went up because shops were
stocking more books that appealed to local customers.

Another of his changes was training really knowledgeable
staff. ‚ÄòIf a customer can tell me what was the last really good
book they read, I know exactly what to sell them next,‚Äô Daunt
says. Given that Waterstones stocks more than 150,000 titles,
this is not an easy thing to do ‚Äî but it is something that is
helping Waterstones to differentiate itself from Amazon.

Daunt is optimistic about the future of bookshops. ‚ÄòPeople love
buying books,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a physical pleasure that customers
don‚Äôt get when they shop online. If we keep creating shops
that do that, it doesn‚Äôt matter what goes on online. High streets
and shops are part of the heart of the community. People will
always want to go to shops.‚Äô
