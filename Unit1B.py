Since ancient times, colour has been linked to the way we

think and feel. For early humans, the red of fire signalled

danger. Later, artists used coloured glass in church windows
to represent different feelings, for example, green symbolized
hope. In modern times, the colours we use to paint the walls in our
houses can affect our mood. So which colours should we use when
we are decorating?

Red is an optimistic colour. It‚Äôs a good colour for a dining room,
because it makes people feel sociable. It stimulates conversation
and makes you feel hungry. But as it‚Äôs a strong colour, it can
sometimes be a bit too much, and even give people headaches. You
could just paint one wall red, or use it for accessories such as lamps
and curtains. However, never use red in a baby‚Äôs bedroom, as it may
stop the baby from sleeping. Pink, on the other hand, is often used
in bedrooms. It‚Äôs traditionally the colour of love ‚Äî a pale shade can
be peaceful and restful, while a darker shade can suggest passion.
Some people think it‚Äôs a very ‚Äògirlie‚Äô colour, so adding in areas of
dark grey or black to this colour scheme can help make it more
generally attractive.

If you want a warm, comforting effect, try orange. It‚Äôs also good
for dining rooms, as it‚Äôs said that it helps you digest your food.
However, like red, it‚Äôs a strong colour and can make a room look
smaller, so only use it in a room that gets plenty of light. A colour
that‚Äôs great for smaller spaces, on the other hand, is yellow. It‚Äôs
a happy, energetic colour, and is a good colour for a kitchen, as
apparently, it discourages insects! It‚Äôs not very restful though, so
it‚Äôs best not to use it for a bedroom.

Purple is good for rooms where you work, for example, a study or
a bedroom, because it‚Äôs a very creative, stimulating colour. However,
it‚Äôs another colour that can make it difficult for people to relax after
a busy day, so if you use it in a bedroom, it‚Äôs a good idea to combine
it with a lighter shade or another colour. Blue is also suitable for a
study, because it helps you to think and concentrate, as well as being
calm and restful. It‚Äôs a popular colour for bathrooms, and bedrooms
too, where a lot of people spend ‚Äòthinking time‚Äô. Another calming
colour is green, and it‚Äôs also good for a bedroom or living room.
Green makes people feel relaxed and less stressed, but it can make
them lazy, so if you don‚Äôt want people to go to sleep on the sofa,
choose cushions and carpets in a bright colour like red or orange.

For people who prefer neutral colours, brown can be a good
choice. Although it can be boring, it‚Äôs a safe, reliable colour ina
living room, and you can paint one wall green or blue if you want a
bit of extra mental stimulation! Other neutral colours, like white,
grey, and beige, are always in fashion. White is the most flexible.
It‚Äôs safe and clean, and you can add any other colours to make the
room look brighter. However, white isn‚Äôt great for a bedroom if you
want to relax there ‚Äî a survey showed that people with a white
bedroom tended to work in bed at least three times a week. Finally,
the most dramatic, and perhaps eccentric, choice of bedroom wall
colour is black. In fact, it works in any room in moderation, for
example, one black wall.
