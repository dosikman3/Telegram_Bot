He gives away his salary
to save the world

Working for a big financial company in London on a six-figure salary,
Wigs might expect Grayden Reece-Smith to be living a lavish lifestyle, going on expensive
holidays or driving a sports car around south London, where he lives. In fact,
the 28-year-old lives a very different existence from his colleagues. He lives on a figure that he calculated he could comfortably live on.

Over the past five years, Reece-Smith has handed over more than
¬£250,000 to organizations such as International Care Ministries, which helps the poor, and the Against Malaria Foundation. He is part of a growing number
of young professionals described as ‚Äòeffective altruists‚Äô. Effective altruists
typically donate regularly to a charity which they think will have a significant
impact. Some choose high-paying careers to make more money, which can then be given away.

Reece-Smith considered working in the charity sector after graduating
from university, but calculated that he could make a bigger difference by
donating a large part of his salary. He had taught at a school in ‚ÄòTanzania, but
then realized that earning and giving would be more effective. ‚ÄúThe cost of
my flights there could have paid the salaries of two teachers for an entire
year,‚Äù he says. Instead, he could ‚Äòstay at home, living a nice life and still make a significant impact.

He is not frugal last year he went to Cuba on holiday, and he enjoys his life. But his
lifestyle isn‚Äôt as luxurious as some of the people he works with.
"I tend not to buy supermarket-branded food products, but I don't deprive myself. Other
people on my salary might have a bigger house. Some of my colleagues have
four-bedroom houses, but we only bought what we needed ~ a two-bedroom
flat. ¬£42,000 is more than enough to live on and still save,‚Äô he says.
