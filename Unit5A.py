A few years ago, if you‚Äôd mentioned to a British
At or colleague that you were addicted to a

Danish drama series, people would have thought
you were a bit strange. But in the UK today, subtitled

foreign-language dramas aren‚Äôt just in fashion, they‚Äôre
completely mainstream.

It all began when the BBC bought the French crime drama Spiral,
though it was Denmark‚Äôs The Killing that was the tipping point.

‚ÄòI remember hearing people talking about it on the bus,‚Äô admits Sue
Deeks, Head of Programming at the BBC. ‚ÄòIt was clearly growing and
growing in popularity, but the extent of it took everyone by surprise.‚Äô
The killing was followed by The Bridge, in which a crime is committed
on the bridge between Denmark and Sweden, which regularly topped
a million viewers. The British were hooked.

One of the reasons for the success of foreign TV is that it is more
accessible than it used to be, thanks to catch-up and online services.
And if you haven‚Äôt watched the latest foreign series that everybody is
talking about, you can binge watch the episodes that you‚Äôve missed,
and tweet about how much you love The Returned.

There may be something else in foreign

TV‚Äôs new popularity, too. In a world ‚ÄòWhen you read
in which we're frequently distracted subtitles, you

from our TV viewing by Twitter and have to be glued
WhatsApp, subtitles force us to focus. to the screen‚Äô
‚ÄúWhen you read subtitles, you have

to be glued to the screen, says Deeks. ‚ÄúThat concentration gives a
particular intensity to the viewing experience. You just can‚Äôt multitask
when you're watching a foreign-language drama.‚Äô

And while foreign-language dramas are often remade for the
Anglo-American market ‚Äî for example, The Bridge became The

Tunnel ‚Äî the originals still dominate, because they transport us to a
different culture. As Walter Iuzzolino, who has set up a new streaming 
service dedicated to foreign-language TV, says, ‚ÄúYou develop a
love for the distant world, because while you‚Äôre watching, you're in
the country. If you see something amazing set in Argentina, then
Argentina itself, the houses, the people, what they wear, what their
voices sound like, the language, is one of the
biggest appeals. There is a huge pleasure in that.
